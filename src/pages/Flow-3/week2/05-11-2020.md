#### Recap on Threads

_We will recap on thread programming continuing with what you learned last semester. More specifically we will focus on how to "return" data from a thread using the traditional Thread-API (the Runnable interface). For (yellow)/red students we will introduce Callables and Futures as an alternative way of "returning" data from threads._

_We need all this, to make endpoints, which in order to make a response, must communicate with a number of external API's_

### Before this lesson you should:

- :book: Read page-1 of todays exercises, to see WHY you need todays topics (5 min.)
- :tv: [Watch this video to see why and how you can parallelize long lasting tasks (TBD)](#)
- :book: [Java Callable Future Example (20 min. should give you time to execute the example) (Red students)](https://www.journaldev.com/1090/java-callable-future-example)
