#### Recap on Threads

_We will recap on thread programming continuing with what you learned last semester. More specifically we will focus on how to "return" data from a thread using the traditional Thread-API the `Runnable` interface)._

_After that we will introduce `Callables` and `Futures` as a better way to "return" data from threads._

_We need all this, to make endpoints, which in order to make a response, must communicate with a number of external API's_

### Before this lesson you should:

#### Important fact about this lesson

_I'm partly using the "flipped classroom" strategy today, which means that a part of the lecture related to this day must be seen BEFORE the lecture (the video-series given below)._

_I will assume you have done that and use what was presented in the video, as a topic for a discussion in the class_

- :book: Read page-1 of todays exercises, to see WHY you need todays topics (5 min.)
- :tv: [Watch this video-series (BEFORE the lesson), to see why and how you can parallelize long lasting tasks (60. min.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzG1pYK4Zkc&list=PLDbigcKhXkiXBwwFg9llduxdLIOkCA6wb)
- :book: [Java Callable Future Example (15. min. should give you time to execute the example)](https://howtodoinjava.com/java/multi-threading/callable-future-example/)
