## Review

Time to reflect and catch up

 What we will do:

- Students will present answers to questions about React. Invitation to present is sent out on Slack channel on a first come, first serve basis. 
- Review last weeks exercises. In particular the CRUD exercise with forms and lifting state
- Optional Kahoot bonanza session
