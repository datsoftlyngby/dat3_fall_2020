# What is SYS on third semester?
The Datamatiker education aims at making students into systems developers who can take responsibility for all aspects of creating of software solution from A-Z. Part of that requires skills in project management, collecting requirements, make systems design, and documentation. At first these disciplines can seem a bit dull, but if you look deeper into the matter, you will probably find that it's much more interesting than meets the eye.

This semester will end with a separate SYS exam where you will demonstrate methodologies, thoughts, and practices within systems development based on a semester project.

SYS contains topics ranging from the technical to the philisophical domain. Today we start out in both departments by discussing how to document code and then we will get started by documenting an api. 


# Before this lesson you should:
- [:book: How to document source code responsibly](https://medium.com/@andrewgoldis/how-to-document-source-code-responsibly-2b2f303aa525). Read this article. It contains important thoughts on when and how to document your code.

# Template for documenting an api
- [Simple paper API documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SUe4aZ-hGW3mYO9c6DmBq_X0dbjGhl4Lr5VTLEb2yco/edit?usp=sharing)
