# What is SYS on third semester?
The Datamatiker education aims at making you into systems developers who can take responsibility for all aspects of creating af software solution from A-Z. Part of that requires skills in project management, collecting requirements, make systems design, and documentation. At first these disciplines can seem a bit dull, but if you look deeper into the matter, you will probably find that it's much more interesting than meets the eye.

This semester will end with a separate SYS exam where you will demonstrate methodologies, thoughts, and practices within systems development based on a semester project.

SYS contains topics ranging from the technical to the philisophical domain. Today we start out in both departments by discussing and implementing the framework Open API. 


# An introduction to Open API

The idea is to introduce OpenAPI, a standard meant to document (+ many other things) a REST API. If you follow on in today's tutorial you will be able to document your CA-2 (and all future REST API's) as done for this sample [Petshop](https://petstore.swagger.io/)

Shit, you might think, that will take a lot of time on top of everything else we have to do for CA-2. 
**Actually not ;-)**

The extra work will all happen today, which will end up with a version of the start code, which are ready to use OpenAPI for documentation. When this is ready, you should actually find that things are simpler, and therefore faster :-)


# Before this lesson you should:
- [:book: There's No Reason to Write OpenAPI By Hand](https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/theres-no-reason-to-write-openapi-by-hand). Read this article. It's not an easy read, but it contains important thoughts on api documentation.
