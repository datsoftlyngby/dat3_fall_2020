### Before this lesson you should:
This week we begin by elaborating on the JPA methodology. In particular we want to work with **associations and multiplicity**. We also want to use the full CRUD amory.

Experience has told us, that most students at 3rd semester are lacking (or at least forgotten) basic relational database theory. In particular how to work with many interrelated tables. It is such a crucial skill, that we suggest you begin by watching two classic videos on the topic. The videos are done in response to the infamouse "Dolphin"-assignment on 1st semester. Most likely, we were way to ambitious at that time ;-) So brew yourself a cup of coffee and bring yourself up-to-date with some database theory and examples.

The big question is then: how do you do that with JPA?

Browse through the list of articles below the videos. Just to get an impression of the landscape we are entering. More details will be provided on Tuesday.

**Important**, *before you read the Wiki articles given as references for this lesson* 
In most of the "technical" sections, you will find two examples. One, who specifies the mapping with annotations and another (the old way) who does it via XML-mappings *We will ONLY use annotation based mappings, so you can, and should, ALWAYS skip the XML-parts*. Don't be scared about "all" the links in the following. They are all just small sections in the same (wiki) book.
