## How to hand in this week

Since a 50% of what we have done this week involved deployment CI, and test this is how you should hand-in

- Code, for all exercises must be organised, and pushed to git as explained for week-1's SP1
- For the movie exercise you must deploy your project on your droplet, PREFERABLY, done by Travis
- You should add all your web exercises (day4) to the project above, for example as ex1.html, ex2.html â€¦
- Add links to each page on index.html.
- Your index.html file must include a link to the git-repository containing all code for this week.
- Your index.html file must include a link to your Travis status page
- Your index.html should include a small description of how far you came (could be taken from the Readme-file)

*What you hand in is: the single link to this page*

Add your hand-in link here: https://forms.gle/4VubTU21RHtbkDdg9 

_If for whatever reason you could not deploy, hand in a link to your git-repo with code for the exercises, but you ARE expected to be able to deploy code by now._

## Part-1 Complete all exercises (according to your colour level) from this week

<!-- REMOVE ME: The tag below will insert all day-exercises given for this week -->
<!-- REMOVE ME: PeriodFolder and weekFolder MUST match the real folder names -->

## Part-2

### Add a JavaScript-driven frontend to your REST-API

#### If you completed and, partly ;-), understood the exercise "Getting Started with the fetch-API" do this
Continue with part-2 of the exercise "_REST, JPA, Test and CI with our start code_" where you implemented a small movie-application.
Add a simple JavaScript-driven page to the project that fetches and render data from one, or more, of your REST-endpoints.
Make sure to deploy via Travis and not manually.

#### If not, do this:

Begin building a front-end to the Movie REST API from earlier this week. Eventually we want to fetch data from the Movie API, but since we have postponed fetching api-data with javascript until Monday, the first iteration of the page only contains the outline of the user interface in pure html and css:

<img src="movie_ui.png" width="640" />

Make sure to deploy via Travis and not manually.
